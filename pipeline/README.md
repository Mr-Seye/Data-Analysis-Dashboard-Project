# Pipeline

## Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
The trucks with the highest transaction counts could benefit from perhaps slight increase in stock and price points (customers may not take this positively), which may see an increase in profits if customer rates don't drop


Recommendation 2:
Could consider new pricing strategies for low-revenue trucks in order to upturn profits for these trucks.

Recommendation 3:
Potentially also revise the menus of low-income trucks in order to increase interest, in turn increasing profits.



This folder should contain all code and resources required for the pipeline.
